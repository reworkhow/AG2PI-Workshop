# AG2PI-Workshop

This repository contains files related to severaal specific events organized by the Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative (AG2PI):

1. AG2PI Workshop #14, titled 'Intermediate Omics Data-Enabled Genomic Prediction and Mediation Analysis.' This workshop focuses on the use of intermediate omics data (comprehensive sets of molecular measurements) for predicting genetic values and phenotypes, and conducting mediation analysis.

2. AG2PI Field Day #27, titled 'Homomorphic Encryption to Enable Sharing of Confidential Data in Agricultural Genome to Phenome.' This event discusses the application of homomorphic encryption, a method that allows computations on encrypted data, to facilitate secure sharing of confidential data in the field of agricultural genomics and phenomics."
