# AG2PI-Workshop

This repository contains files related to several specific events organized by the Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative (AG2PI):

1. AG2PI Workshop #14, titled '[Intermediate Omics Data-Enabled Genomic Prediction and Mediation Analysis](https://www.ag2pi.org/workshops-and-activities/workshop-2022-07-26/)'. This workshop focuses on the use of intermediate omics data (comprehensive sets of molecular measurements) for predicting genetic values and phenotypes, and conducting mediation analysis.

2. AG2PI Field Day #27, titled '[Homomorphic Encryption to Enable Sharing of Confidential Data in Agricultural Genome to Phenome](https://www.ag2pi.org/workshops-and-activities/field-day-2023-06-21/)'. This event discusses the application of homomorphic encryption, a method that allows computations on encrypted data, to facilitate secure sharing of confidential data in the field of agricultural genomics and phenomics."
