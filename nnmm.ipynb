Nodes in the middle layer represent intermediate traits, e.g., the known intermediate omics features such as gene expression levels can be incorporated in the middle layer. These three sequential layers form a unified network. \n",

In the figure above, for an individual, the gene expression levels of the first two genes are 0.9 and 0.1, respectively, and the gene expression level of the last gene is missing to be sampled. The missing patterns of gene expression levels can be different for different individuals."
